# Minimum Viable Dataspace Consumer

This repository contains the consumer of the [Minimum Viable Dataspace](https://github.com/Smightym8/MinimumViableDataspace/tree/edc-0.11.0).

Its purpose is to demonstrate a simple deployment of dataspace components using a CI/CD pipeline hosted on Azure DevOps and Docker.

## Using the repository as template for a deployment
To use the repository as a template there is a dedicated template branch that can be used: [https://github.com/Smightym8/mvd-consumer/tree/template](https://github.com/Smightym8/mvd-consumer/tree/template).
This repository's deployment setup includes two other repositories. **In addition to this template, the provider is mandatory for a functioning data space**, whereas the Kubernetes deployment of the consumer is optional.
The other two repositories also have a template branch that can be used as a starting point:
- [Provider Docker Compose Deployment Template](https://github.com/Smightym8/mvd-provider/tree/template)
- [Consumer Kubernetes Deployment Template](https://github.com/Smightym8/mvd-consumer-kubernetes/tree/template)

The following image shows the final setup that was achieved through the deployment of this repository and the other two repositories.
It acts as an overview of how the deployment can look like.

### Prerequisites for a deployment
In the following the Server that hosts the deployed dataspace components is referred to as Application Server.

- Infrastructure services need to be present and accessible for the dataspace. This includes PostgreSQL, Hashicorp Vault and the Dataspace Issuer.
    - In the directory `external` you can find a directory for each of the infrastructure services that can be used to quickly deploy them on a server such as shown in the image above.
    - If the infrastructure services are hosted as Docker containers on the Application Server, they need to be in the same Docker network as the dataspace components.
- A Docker Registry to push the Docker images of the dataspace components to.
- A server with Docker and Docker Compose installed to host the dataspace components.
- A build server with JDK 17 and Docker installed for building the components and Docker images.

### Deployment Steps for the Consumer
1. Copy the template branch of this repository.
2. Put the project under version control.
3. Replace the placeholders with the IP Addresses of the consumer, issuer and provider.
    - In the template branch are placeholders. You can use the search and replace function of your IDE/Editor.
    - The used placeholders are: 
        - `[INSERT CONSUMER IP]`
        - `[INSERT ISSUER IP]`
        - `[INSERT SIGNED VC AS JWT]`
        - `[INSERT PROVIDER IP]`
        - `[INSERT CONSUMER DID AS BASE64 STRING]`
        - `[INSERT DOCKER REGISTRY]`
    - If you use the dataspace issuer of the template repository from the directory `external/dataspace-issuer`, you can use the `*.pem` files of the issuer for signing the Verifiable Credentials. For decoding and encoding JWTs the website [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) can be used.
    - To encode and decode the base64 string in the seed script you can use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).
4. Adapt the CI/CD Pipeline to your needs. Based on your setup and the CI/CD platform you use, you need to change the pipeline provided in this repository. The pipeline should include the following steps:
    - `./gradlew clean`
    - `./gradlew build`
    - `./gradlew -Ppersistence=true dockerize`
    - A step for each Docker image that pushes the image to a Docker Registry
    - If the Build Server is a different Server than Application Server: Add a step to transfer the deployment directory containing the assets and the file `docker-compose.yml` to a location of your choice on the Application Server for example to `/opt/mvd`. Normally CI/CD platforms have a dedicated SFTP task to copy files to a server.
    - If the Build Server is the same Server as the Application Server: Copy the directory `deployment` containing the assets and the file `docker-compose.yml` to a location of your choice on the current server for example to `/opt/mvd`.
    - Add a step with the following commands to deploy the dataspace with docker compose:
        - `cd [directory containing docker-compose.yml]` (Example: `cd /opt/mvd`)
        - `docker compose down`
        - `docker compose pull`
        - `docker compose up -d`
    - Recommended: Add a clean up step to delete the Docker images on the build server created by the gradle dockerize command. 
    - After the deployment, execute the script `deployment/scripts/seed.sh` on the Application Server
        - You can also execute the script on your local machine but then you have to change the values in the script
